					I live in Beijing. Before moving here, I never looked up the air quality. In Beijing, it's a bit different. You know you've been here for a while if the first thing you do when you arrive in a different country is to check the AQI (Air Quality Index).
				</p>
				<p>
					Where people elsewhere are obsessed with the weather, here it's all about AQI. Possibly because, save air quality, the forecast is straightforward; scorching hot or freezing, with a few weeks of spring or fall in between.
				</p>
				<p>
					The AQI can make or break your day. What could be have been a perfect day for lounging at the pool becomes a sad Saturday spent inside, on a 'bad airday'.

					At Xiaomi, I worked on the India launch of the Mi Air Purifier 2. The launch event was set to happen in Delhi, which in recent years has come to rival Beijing in terms of air pollution. In the launch presentation, we sketched out a problem (bad air pollution) and a solution (an affordable air purifier in your home). we compared the air quality in Beijing, Delhi, and San Francisco. Finding out that several government agencies publish air quality data online was an eye opener.
